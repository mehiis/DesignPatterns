<b>Code Cracker Game</b><br>
A simple, turn-based code cracking game where players attempt to guess a secret code. The game is programmed using a provided template method.<br><br>

<b>Game instructions:</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ This game can be played by 1-4 players.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Your mission: crack the secret 4-digit code.<br><br>

<b>How to play:</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Each round, enter a guess consisting of four numbers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ After each guess, you will receive feedback:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ A number in the correct position and correct value.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ A number that exists in the code but is in the wrong position.<br><br>

Keep guessing until you discover the full code.
If all four numbers are guessed correctly in the right order, the code is broken, and you win the game! üèÜ
