# Assignment 20: Iterator design pattern

This project demonstrates the usage of the Iterator design pattern. It iterates through the Fibonacci sequence using a custom iterator.
<br><br>
`Sequence`: An interface for any potential sequence. It defines a method to assign an iterator to the sequence.
<br>`FibonacciSequence`: A concrete class representing the Fibonacci sequence. It implements the Sequence interface.
<br>`FibonacciIterator`: Responsible for iterating through the Fibonacci sequence. It implements the Iterator interface and ensures the correct sequence of numbers is returned.
