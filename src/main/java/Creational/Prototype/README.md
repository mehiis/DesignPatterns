# Assignment 17: Prototype design pattern

This is a simple project demonstrating the Prototype design pattern, using a basic command-line interface.
<br><i>(For which I apologize, because the code is awful and I just should have done it wit JavaFX, but there was no turning back when I realized what an unholy mess I have made).</i>

In this project, `Book` and `Recommendation` classes are created once and then cloned to produce new instances, following the principles of the Prototype pattern.
