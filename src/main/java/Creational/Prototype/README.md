# Assignment 18: Prototype design pattern

This is a simple project demonstrating the Prototype design pattern, using a basic command-line interface.
<br><i>For which I apologize, the code is awful, and I really should have used JavaFX. But there was no turning back once I realized what an unruly mess I've made. **Lessons were learned...**</i>

In this project, `Book` and `Recommendation` classes are created once and then cloned to produce new instances, following the principles of the Prototype pattern.
