A simple sorting machine implemented with the Strategy design pattern. It sorts small and large integer arrays using three different algorithms, which can be swapped at runtime through the strategy pattern.

<b>Sorting algorithms used:</b>
<li>Comb sort. copied from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/comb-sort/</li>
<li>Insertion sort. copied from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/insertion-sort-algorithm/</li>
<li>Selection sort. copied from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/selection-sort-algorithm-2/</li>
